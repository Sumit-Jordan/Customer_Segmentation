In this project
I conducted a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using a diverse dataset of purchasing behavior. 
By employing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and KMeans clustering, I identified distinct customer groups, optimized the number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette score, and visualized the results for clear interpretation. 
These findings provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies and improved business decision-making. 
This project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and the application of machine learning techniques to derive meaningful business insights.
